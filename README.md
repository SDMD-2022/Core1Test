# Core1Test

This is a test file for Core 1.

Please copy the file into your androidTest directory. You will need to edit the package name, as well as add `androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test:rules:1.4.0-beta02'` to your Gradle file (app level). (Please see the latest version numbers at https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/test, however this was tested with 1.4.0-beta02 and API 30 -- API 31 seems to raise an error, however it has been stated from the start of the unit that beta APIs should not be used.)

To run the tests, click on the arrows next to `class MainActivityTest`. This will open an emulator (or use your device)  and run through the steps in the tests. Test statuses will be shown at the bottom of the IDE (under Run). 

If you are unable to run the tests, the test cases are described in the files for you to test manually.

Note at this stage colour is unable to be reliably tested.
